    <p>The Venice Carnival is the annual celebration over Venice Republic's victory over the Patriarch.The Venice Carnival is all about the masked costume balls. An example of these masked costumes can be seen in the picture next to this. During this there are a lot of expensive balls along with free ones you can attend as well. One of the most in-demand ones is the famous Il Ballo del Doge. These balls usually sell out quite quickly due to their fame. 
   The Venice Carnival is connected to a Catholic custom that marked a period of indecency before the season of Lent began. This year's Venice Carnival is marked to be happening on Saturday, February 4 and ending on Tuesday, February 21. </p>
